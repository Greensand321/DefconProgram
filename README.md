# DefconProgram

This project implements a fictional Cold War style command center using Lua and the CC:Tweaked mod for Minecraft.

The code has been reorganized into a modular structure located in the `services/`, `modules/` and `config/` folders. Run `services/command_center.lua` on your main computer to access the interface. Remote computers can run `services/remote_listener.lua` to respond to commands.

See `docs/README.md` for additional details.

## Password

The door control program uses the password `defcon1`.
